Structure

    iOS/
        Contains Xcode project for iOS application


Requirements

    To run the iOS project, you must use Xcode 13.3 or later

How it Works

The IOS App relies on the powerful framework PDFKit, however, since this frameword is available only in UIKit, the App had to be adapted in order to merge UIKit Swift documents in an almost fully composed SwiftUI project. In order to do that, we used UIViewRepresentable, UIViewControllerRepresentable and UINavigationControllerDelegate protocols.
